                <h1>Hello World!</h1>
                <p>I'm a self-motivated web developer with a go-getter attitude and a passion for learning. I enjoy working outside my comfort zone, it facilitates learning by forcing me to think outside the box in order to solve difficult problems. Getting comfortable is one of my greatest fears which also makes it one of my strongest motivators.</p>
